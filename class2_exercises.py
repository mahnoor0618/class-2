#Exercise 1

#Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number. e.g. if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8

num=str(input("Enter any two digit number: "))

print(f"{int(num[0])} + {int(num[1])} = {int(num[0])+int(num[1])}")

#Exercise 2

"""Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.

It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.

Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers."""

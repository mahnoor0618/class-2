Beginner Python Exercises & Capstone Project

This repository contains beginner-level Python exercises designed to practice basic programming concepts such as input handling, mathematical operations, string formatting, and user interaction.


🚀 Exercises Overview

Exercise 1: Digit Adder

A simple program that takes a 2-digit number as input and adds the individual digits.

🔢 Example:

Input: 35
Output: 3 + 5 = 8

Exercise 2: Time Left Until Age 90

Calculates how many days, weeks, and months are left until the user turns 90 years old.

📅 Example Output:

You have 21900 days, 3120 weeks and 12 months left.

Exercise 3: BMI Calculator

Takes the user’s weight and height as input, and calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI).

⚖ Formula:

BMI = weight / (height^2)

💡 Uses floor division (//) to return an integer part of BMI and rounds it for cleaner output.

🧠 Capstone Project: Tip Calculator

This final project calculates how much each person should pay after adding a tip to a total restaurant bill.

🍽 Example:

Total Bill: $150
Tip: 12%
People: 5
Each Person Pays: $33.60

💡 The total with tip is calculated and divided among the number of people. Result is formatted to two decimal places.
